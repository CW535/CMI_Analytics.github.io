          <p>Used by companies and marketing firms to determine how quickly their message is disseminating through a network, as well as finding who retains the greatest influence within a group, i.e. an influencer. As a CMI capability, this would be useful for the same purpose it is useful for product and marketing industries: to determine audience reach and message absorption. Additionally, it is useful to see which communities a user is active in because this provides an opportunity to see if there is a commonality among the topics (they chose to engage in). Commonality could lead to predictability and predictability could lead to a higher confidence that a user will engage in a convo about the latest shake-up in their respective community’s vs being a quiet observer. – Analyze user movement between communities –

    <p>I think the super spreader paper would be an easy win since we just add a formula and examine results. It would be quick and would require less than 40 hours. Radicalization is using pure statistics and although we could implement it, not my forte. The convolutional neural network in some of the papers are standard and although we could implement it, we would need GPU resources which we currently do not have. To code up a prototype for the two papers you posted earlier in the week it could take about 40 hours. But we would need GPU resources if we were to implement neural networks.  - <i>Word for word by Tulio Tablada</i> </p>
